# üî¢ SYCL Vector Add (USM vs Buffers)

This sample demonstrates vector addition using SYCL with two memory models:
- **USM (Unified Shared Memory)**
- **Buffers + Accessors**

## üß† Key Difference (‚â§ 50 words)

**USM** uses raw pointers and requires manual memory management.  
**Buffers** abstract memory with automatic data movement and synchronization.  
USM is more explicit and low-level; Buffers are higher-level and safer.
